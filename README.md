#  Chess Games and Positions Graph Model on Neo4j

Modeling for Graph databases is just as important as ever. Even though there is no external schema overlooking our data model by default, 
there is still a clear and important need to model. 
The way to define the structure of the data that we are planning to store in Neo4j needs to be documented in a clear and 
understandable fashion. There are several tools that we can use for the development of our graph model. 

We used the homegrown open source toolset developed by Alistair Jones and GraphAlchemist, 
appropriately called <b>Arrows</b>. Originally started by Neo Technology's, Alistair Jones (www.apcjones.com) as a side project for graph documentation and visualization, the Arrows toolset today enables very easy and useable documentation of graph database models. 
The tool is available online at www.apcjones.com/arrows and provides very basic but advanced graph drawing capabilities.
